    <h2>Welcome to my pomo art project!!</h2>
    <p>To view the ghosts, find the piece of paper labelled "semiotic ghosts." It will be somewhere in the classroom. Then, click on one of the links below (to one of the ghosts), and point the camera towards the black box labeled with "Hiro" on the sheet of paper. The model should populate over the this black box.</p>
    <p>When viewing the model, ensure the entire image (black box with "Hiro" inside) is within the camera. You can move the camera around to see more, but the camera needs to see the FULL marker image to populate the 3D model Keep the camera steady and move it slowly.</p>
    <p>You can hit the back arrow in your browser to return to this menu and check out some other ghosts.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Happy hallucinating!</p>
